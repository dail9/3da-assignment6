    "## Chronic Kidney Disease Classification Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Engage with the dataset from the [Early Stage of Indians Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/336/chronic+kidney+disease) project, which comprises data on 250 early-stage CKD patients and 150 healthy controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "For foundational knowledge on the subject, refer to \"Predict, diagnose, and treat chronic kidney disease with machine learning: a systematic literature review\" by [Sanmarchi et al., (2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40620-023-01573-4).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the dataset using two classification algorithms, focusing on exploratory data analysis, feature selection, engineering, and especially on handling missing values and outliers. Summarize your findings with insightful conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classifier Requirement:** Ensure at least one of the classifiers is interpretable, to facilitate in-depth analysis and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Teamwork:** Group submissions should compile the workflow (Python codes and interpretations) into a single PDF, including a GitHub repository link. The contributions listed should reflect the GitHub activity.\n",
    "- **Content:** Address the following questions in your submission, offering detailed insights and conclusions from your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification Problem Identification:** Define and describe a classification problem based on the dataset.\n",
    "2. **Variable Transformation:** Implement any transformations chosen or justify the absence of such modifications.\n",
    "3. **Dataset Overview:** Provide a detailed description of the dataset, covering variables, summaries, observation counts, data types, and distributions (at least three statements).\n",
    "4. **Association Between Variables:** Analyze variable relationships and their implications for feature selection or extraction (at least three statements).\n",
    "5. **Missing Value Analysis and Handling:** Implement your strategy for identifying and addressing missing values in the dataset, or provide reasons for not addressing them.\n",
    "6. **Outlier Analysis:** Implement your approach for identifying and managing outliers, or provide reasons for not addressing them.\n",
    "7. **Sub-group Analysis:** Explore potential sub-groups within the data, employing appropriate data science methods to find the sub-groups of patients and visualize the sub-groups. The sub-group analysis must not include the labels (for CKD patients and healthy controls).\n",
    "8. **Data Splitting:** Segregate 30% of the data for testing, using a random seed of 1. Use the remaining 70% for training and model selection.\n",
    "9. **Classifier Choices:** Identify the two classifiers you have chosen and justify your selections.\n",
    "10. **Performance Metrics:** Outline the two metrics for comparing the performance of the classifiers.\n",
    "11. **Feature Selection/Extraction:** Implement methods to enhance the performance of at least one classifier in (9). The answer for this question can be included in (12).\n",
    "12. **Classifier Comparison:** Utilize the selected metrics to compare the classifiers based on the test set. Discuss your findings (at least two statements).\n",
    "13. **Interpretable Classifier Insight:** After re-training the interpretable classifier with all available data, analyze and interpret the significance of predictor variables in the context of the data and the challenge (at least two statements).\n",
    "14. **[Bonus]** Sub-group Improvement Strategy: If sub-groups were identified, propose and implement a method to improve one classifier performance further. Compare the performance of the new classifer with the results in (12).\n",
    "15. **Team Contributions:** Document each team member's specific contributions related to the questions above.\n",
    "16. **Link** to the public GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- This assignment encourages you to apply sophisticated machine learning methods to a vital healthcare challenge, promoting the development of critical analytical skills, teamwork, and practical problem-solving abilities in the context of chronic kidney disease diagnosis and treatment.\n",
    "- Students can choose one classifer not covered in the lectures."
